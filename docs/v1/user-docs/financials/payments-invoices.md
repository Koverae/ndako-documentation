# Payments & Invoices

In Ndako, you can easily manage payments and generate invoices for your guests and tenants. This feature ensures that all financial transactions are tracked seamlessly.

## Making Payments

1. **Record a Payment**  
   To record a payment, navigate to the booking or tenant record and select **Record Payment**. You can then choose the payment method, such as credit/debit card, mobile money, or cash, and enter the payment amount.

2. **Payment Confirmation**  
   Once the payment is processed, it will be reflected in the system. You will receive a confirmation, and both the guest/tenant and property manager will be notified.

3. **Partial Payments**  
   If a payment is made in installments (down payments), the system will track the amount paid and the remaining balance.

4. **Payment History**  
   You can view the entire payment history for a guest, tenant, or property by going to the **Payment History** section. This will show all payments made, the amount, and the payment status.

## Invoices

Ndako generates automatic invoices for each payment made, which can be sent to guests/tenants and stored for future reference.

### How to Generate an Invoice

1. **Invoice Creation**  
   Invoices are generated automatically when a payment is recorded. You can view the invoice in the guest/tenant record or the booking details.

2. **Customize Invoices**  
   The system allows you to customize the invoice format, adding your company logo and other details specific to your property.

3. **Send Invoices**  
   After creating an invoice, you can email it directly to your guests or tenants or download it as a PDF for offline use.

4. **Invoice History**  
   All issued invoices are stored in the system for easy access and reference. You can filter by guest, date, or status (paid, pending).
