# Team & Permissions

Managing your team and controlling access to different parts of the system is essential. Ndako allows you to add team members, assign roles, and configure their permissions for various tasks.

## Adding Team Members

1. **Invite Team Members**  
   To invite a team member, navigate to the **Team Settings** section and click **Invite Member**. Enter their email address and choose a role.

2. **Roles**  
   You can assign different roles to your team members, such as Admin, Manager, and Staff. Each role comes with different levels of access and permissions.

3. **Assigning Roles**  
   Once a team member is added, you can assign them a specific role. Admins have full control over the platform, while other roles have restricted access.

## Permissions

1. **Managing Permissions**  
   Each role has pre-defined permissions, but you can customize them based on your requirements. Permissions determine what actions a user can perform, such as viewing bookings, updating profiles, or accessing financial reports.

2. **Role-based Access Control**  
   Ndako uses role-based access control (RBAC), which allows you to restrict access to certain features based on the user's role. You can grant or revoke permissions for different actions, such as managing payments or viewing guest information.

3. **Team Member Audit**  
   Keep track of all actions performed by team members. The audit log helps you monitor which actions were taken by specific team members and when.
