## 🏠 Units and Rooms

Once your property is set up, you can start adding units and rooms. This is where you manage the physical spaces in your property that guests or tenants will book or use.

### Key Points:
- **Unit Types**: Choose the type of units you want to offer (e.g., studio apartments, suites, offices).
- **Room Information**: If applicable, set up individual rooms within units (e.g., "Room 101", "Oceanview Suite").
- **Add Room Amenities**: Specify the amenities available in each room (e.g., Wi-Fi, air conditioning, TV).

> **Tip**: You can modify or delete units/rooms anytime as your business needs change.
