# How It Works

Ndako simplifies hotel management into a few intuitive workflows.

## 1. Add Your Property

Start by adding a property: name, address, type (residential, hospitality).

Each property can contain multiple units or rooms.

## 2. Set Up Your Units

Define units/rooms with details like:

- Name or number
- Capacity
- Pricing
- Amenities

## 3. Manage Bookings

Depending on your property type:

- 📅 Hospitality: create bookings via the calendar or manually
- 🧍 Residential: add tenants and manage leases `(coming soon)`
