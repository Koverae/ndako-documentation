# Search, filter, and group records
Ndako allows for the searching, filtering, and grouping of records in a view to display only the most relevant records. The search bar is located at the top of the view: start typing to **search for values**, or click the  (dropdown) icon to access the **Filter**, **Group By**, and **Favorites** drop-down menus.

## Search for Values
Use the search field to look for specific values, and add them as a filter. Type the value to search for (like a userâ€™s name or a unit), and select the result from the table.

## Filters
Filters are used to select records that meet specific criteria. The default selection of records is specific to each view, but can be modified by selecting one (or several) **preconfigured** filters.

Modify the default selection of records by clicking the  (**dropdown**) from the search bar, and selecting one (or several) **preconfigured filters** from the **Filters** drop-down menu.
