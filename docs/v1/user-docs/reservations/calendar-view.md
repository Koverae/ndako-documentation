# Calendar View

The Calendar View in Ndako gives you a visual overview of your bookings and availability. Hereâ€™s how to use it effectively:

## Accessing the Calendar

1. **Go to the Calendar Tab**  
   From your dashboard, navigate to the **Calendar** section under the **Reservations** tab.

2. **View Bookings by Day, Week, or Month**  
   You can toggle between daily, weekly, or monthly views depending on the level of detail you need.

3. **Color-Coded Events**  
   Bookings will be color-coded based on their status (confirmed, pending, canceled, etc.) for easy identification.

## Using Filters

1. **Filter by Room Type**  
   You can filter the calendar by room or unit type to see availability for specific areas.

2. **Filter by Date Range**  
   Set a custom date range to view availability or bookings within that period.

3. **Filter by Status**  
   Filter by booking status (e.g., confirmed, pending, etc.) to focus on certain types of bookings.

## Adding New Bookings from the Calendar

You can create new bookings directly from the calendar view by selecting the desired date and room.
