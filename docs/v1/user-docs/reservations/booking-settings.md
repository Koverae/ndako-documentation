# Booking Settings

Booking Settings allow you to customize how bookings are handled in your property. These settings include check-in/check-out times, booking confirmations, and more.

## Key Booking Settings

### 1. **Check-in and Check-out Times**

Set default check-in and check-out times for your property:

- **Example**: Check-in time: 2:00 PM, Check-out time: 11:00 AM.

These times can be adjusted per booking if needed.

### 2. **Booking Confirmation Settings**

Configure how you want to confirm bookings:

- **Instant Confirmation**: Automatically confirm bookings as soon as they’re made.
- **Manual Confirmation**: Review and confirm each booking manually.

### 3. **Deposit Settings**

You can require guests to pay a deposit upfront:

- **Percentage**: Define a percentage of the total amount.
- **Fixed Amount**: Set a fixed amount that must be paid.

### 4. **Overbooking Prevention**

Enable automatic prevention of double bookings:

- **Example**: If a room is already booked for a specific date, it cannot be reserved again.

### 5. **Booking Notifications**

Set up automatic email or SMS notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, and cancellations.
