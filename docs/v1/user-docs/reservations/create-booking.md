# Create a Booking

Ndako provides two methods to create bookings for your property. You can either use the **Booking Wizard** or the **Calendar View** to complete the process.

## Option 1: Create Booking via the Wizard

This method is ideal when you want to create a booking step by step.

### Steps to Create a Booking via the Wizard

1. **Select or Create a Guest**  
   - **Select an Existing Guest**: Choose from your list of registered guests.  
   - **Create a New Guest**: If the guest is not in your system, you can create a new profile by entering their details (name, contact information, etc.).

2. **Select the Date Range**  
   Choose the check-in and check-out dates for the booking. The availability of rooms will be determined by these dates.

3. **Pick a Room**  
   Based on the duration of stay, availability, and the number of guests, Ndako will suggest the best room options. You can choose a room based on your preferences, or manually select another room if needed.

4. **Confirm the Booking**  
   Review the details of the booking, including guest information, room selection, and dates. You will also see a summary of charges.

5. **Payment**  
   Depending on your property’s booking settings, you will be prompted to make a payment. This could be a **full payment** or a **down payment** based on your booking policies.

6. **Confirmation**  
   Once the payment is made, the booking is confirmed, and both you and the guest will receive confirmation notifications.

## Option 2: Create Booking via the Calendar View

This method allows you to select a date range directly from the calendar view and proceed to create a booking using the wizard. It’s ideal for making bookings based on your availability and preferred date.

### Steps to Create a Booking via the Calendar View

1. **Select the Date Range from the Calendar**  
   From the **Calendar View** in your dashboard, select the desired check-in and check-out dates directly on the calendar.

2. **Open the Booking Wizard in a Modal**  
   After selecting the date range, a modal will pop up with the booking wizard, pre-filled with the selected dates.

3. **Follow the Wizard Steps**  
   The steps in the wizard are the same as those in the first option:
   - Select or create a guest.
   - Choose the room based on availability, duration, and capacity.
   - Confirm the booking details.
   - Complete the payment process (full payment or down payment).

4. **Booking Confirmation**  
   After the payment is processed, the booking is confirmed, and both you and the guest will receive notifications.
