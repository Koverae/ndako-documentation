# Booking Policies

Booking policies define the rules and conditions under which bookings are made. These can be adjusted to meet your property's needs.

## Types of Booking Policies

### 1. **Cancellation Policy**

Define the terms for canceling a booking, such as:

- **Non-Refundable**: No refund for cancellations.

### 2. **Minimum Stay Policy**

Set minimum and maximum stay durations for different rooms or units.

- **Example**: Minimum stay of 2 nights during weekends or holidays.

### 3. **Deposit Policy**

Define if a deposit is required to confirm a booking.

- **Percentage of Total**: Require a percentage of the total booking amount upfront.
- **Fixed Amount**: A specific amount that must be paid in advance.

### 4. **Booking Lead Time**
