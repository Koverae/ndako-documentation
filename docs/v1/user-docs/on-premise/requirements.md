# Requirements
Using Ndako on-premise requires that you have a good hosting company.

When selecting a hosting company, check for the following requirements:

## Environment

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Database (e.g., [MySQL](https://laravel.com/docs/database), [PostgreSQL](https://laravel.com/docs/database), [SQLite](https://laravel.com/docs/database), [SQL Server](https://laravel.com/docs/database))
- Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS)
- URL Rewrite (e.g., mod_rewrite for Apache)

## PHP Extensions

- BCMath
- Ctype
- cURL
- DOM
- FileInfo
- Intl
- GD
- JSON
- Mbstring
- OpenSSL
- PDO
- Tokenizer
- XML
- Zip

Almost all hosting companies provide these requirements. However, it would be best to ask before you purchase a hosting plan.

During the installation process, Ndako will check for the listed requirements and will only complete the installation if all requirements are available.

If specific requirements still need to be included, you can contact your hosting provider to make them available.
