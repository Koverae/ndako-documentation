## 🔧 Setting Up Check-in / Check-out

### 1. **Configure Default Check-in and Check-out Times**

To ensure a smooth flow for all guests, set up default check-in and check-out times:

- Navigate to the **Settings > Property Settings > Booking Settings**.
- Locate **Default Check-in/Check-out Times**.
- Set your preferred check-in and check-out times (e.g., 2:00 PM for check-in, 11:00 AM for check-out).

These times will be used as defaults for all bookings, but can be adjusted for individual reservations if necessary.

### 2. **Automate Unit Status Update**

When a guest checks in or out, the status of the unit they are occupying will automatically change. This helps ensure that the property management system reflects real-time availability.

- **Occupied**: Once the guest checks in, the unit’s status will automatically update to “Occupied.”
- **Available**: Once the guest checks out, the unit’s status will automatically update to “Available.”

You can customize this behavior in the **Unit Status** settings under **Property Settings**.
